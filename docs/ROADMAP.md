# ROADMAP — Deepartments phases

Roadmap of the Deepartments project (`dsh-deepartments`): phases with their
status, content and exit criterion, and the phase 2 kickoff tasks. Decisions
and mapping in [concept.md](concept.md); the idea in [IDEA.md](IDEA.md).

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Content | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0. Research** | ✅ **COMPLETE** (2026-08-16) | Research of the DSH plugin API: mapping cells resolved; feasibility confirmed (rc.6, native mechanisms for posts/activations/witness); decisions 1-2. | Report delivered; feasibility verdict: **positive**; mapping with no pending items blocking the MVP. |
| **1. Concept** | ✅ **COMPLETE** (2026-08-16) | v1 draft + debate; 10 v1 questions → 9 binding decisions + naming proposal; the concept (docs/concept.md). | Decisions taken; concept approved; phase 2 authorized. |
| **2. MVP** | 🚀 **READY TO START** | One department (programming) with roles absorbed from the previous setup; persistent posts (continuable + witness); CEO → orchestrator → head → parallel builders → reviewer → verification → commit flow; sleep/wake cycle managed by the plugin; dogfooding on the repo itself; headless. | MVP success criteria (concept.md §4): end-to-end assignment with a post that falls asleep midway and resumes without loss; cycle managed without manual glue. |
| **3. Rooms and activations** | Pending | Multiple rooms with reception and visits; scheduled (`dsh-schedule`) and reactive (events/MCP) activations; assignments between posts; editable governance policy; **client plugin UI — total observer** (decision 2); archiving/querying dead rooms. | Two departments coordinating via head → orchestrator; a scheduled rhythm running without human intervention; a dead room archived and queryable; a governance exception applied; the UI shows the organization's state. |
| **4. Self-observation, quality, self-modification** | Pending | Quality group + dream/post-session interview; proactive contextualizer; operational channeled escalation; self-modification of structure and implementation with safeguards and recovery (default structure). | The organization proposes a structure or implementation change, the CEO approves it, it is applied with quality gates, and the way back (default structure) works. |

## Phase 2 kickoff

Concrete tasks to start development, in order, each with its "done"
criterion. (The `dsh-plugin-dev` skill is created first — Recommendation 1
of the research — so no builder needs to re-research.)

| # | Task | "Done" criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Seed the repo** (docs + skill first): `README.md`, `docs/IDEA.md`, `docs/concept.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `.dsh/skills/dsh-plugin-dev/SKILL.md` (verbatim text of the concept annex) + initial commit. | `git status` clean in `/home/esuarez/projects/deepartments`; a builder session in the repo loads the `dsh-plugin-dev` skill from the catalog (root `<project>/.dsh/skills`, rank 100). |
| 2 | **Development profile**: create `deepartments-dev` (headless template, independent port) for development and smoke without touching the web profile. | `dsh --profile deepartments-dev --dump-config` composes without errors; the headless boot starts on its own port. |
| 3 | **Bundle scaffold**: `package.json` (name `dsh-deepartments`, 0.1.0-rc.1, `dsh.bundle`, rc peerDeps), `cordis.patch.yml` (`deepartments` row), minimal `src/index.ts` (`name`/`inject`/`apply` with a log effect), tsconfig NodeNext, build to `lib/`. | `dsh plugin --profile deepartments-dev add /home/esuarez/projects/deepartments` installs and `dsh --profile deepartments-dev --dump-config` shows the `# == dsh-deepartments` layer. |
| 4 | **First `dept_*` tool**: `dept_post_create` (creates a post: `session.append('deepartments/post-created', …)` + optional `startContinuable`) and, if applicable, `dept_witness_write`. | A headless smoke creates a post and the `deepartments/*` event appears in the session log (verifiable via session listing or projection). |
| 5 | **Witness skeleton**: frontmatter+body convention + post state projection (`sessionProjections`) + `agent/turn-stopping` listener that writes the witness on sleep. | A post writes a witness, falls asleep (event `deepartments/post-sleep` with witness) and **wakes in a new session with the witness loaded without loss** — MVP success criterion 1. |
| 6 | **Dogfooded end-to-end flow**: the programming department runs on the repo: CEO → orchestrator → head → N builders in parallel → reviewer → verification → commit, with a real plugin-building assignment. | Complete assignment with a post asleep halfway without loss and **no manual orchestrator glue** — MVP success criterion 2. |

## Current status

- **2026-08-16** — phases 0 and 1 complete; phase 2 ready to start; task 1
  (seed the repo) in progress.
